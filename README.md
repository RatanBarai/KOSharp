## Features

- **Login Server**: Handles user authentication and session management.
- **Game Server**: Manages game logic, player interactions, and world state.
- **Packet Handling**: Efficiently processes incoming and outgoing packets.
- **Modular Architecture**: Easily extendable and customizable.
- **Open Source**: Community-driven development.

## Usage

After setting up the server, you can run it using the following command:

```bash
dotnet run
```

### Configuration

You can configure the server settings in the `appsettings.json` file. This includes database connections, server ports, and other parameters. Make sure to adjust these settings according to your environment.

## Architecture Overview

KOSharp is designed with a modular architecture. This allows developers to easily add new features or modify existing ones. The main components are:

- **Login Server**: This component handles user login requests and maintains user sessions. It communicates with the Game Server to authenticate users.

- **Game Server**: The core of the gameplay experience. It manages the game world, player actions, and interactions. It also handles NPCs, quests, and events.

- **Database Layer**: Responsible for storing player data, game state, and other persistent information. You can use any SQL-based database, but MySQL is recommended for its performance and ease of use.

- **Networking Layer**: Handles TCP connections and packet communication between the client and server. It ensures efficient data transfer and low latency.

## Packet Handling

Packet handling is a critical part of any game server. KOSharp uses a custom packet structure to facilitate communication between the client and server. 

### Incoming Packets

The server listens for incoming packets from the client. Each packet is processed based on its type. This includes:

- Login packets
- Movement packets
- Combat packets
- Chat packets

### Outgoing Packets

The server sends packets back to the client to update the game state. This includes:

- Player status updates
- World events
- NPC interactions
